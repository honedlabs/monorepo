 * I loop over columns. Create the sorts, filters, searches.

 * I need to loop over and toggle the active columns.
 * 
 * When selecting 'relation.name'. If the name of the column has a dot, then it's a relationship.
 * -> add a ->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->with('relation')) but it needs to check if one has been set.
